    "### Exercise # 02: Develop a registration system for a University. It should consist of three classes name Student, Teacher, and Course. For our example, a student needs to have a name, rol number, address and GPA to be eligible for registration. Therefore choose appropriate data types for encapsulating these properties in a Student object/s. Similarly a teache needs to have name, address, telephone number, and a degree (or a list of degrees) he ha received. Finally courses must have a name, students (5 students) registered for the course and a teacher assigned to conduct the course. Create an object of Course with 5 Student and a Teacher. A call to a method, say printDetails(), of the selected course reference shoul print name of the course, details of the teacher assigned to that course, and names and rol numbers of the students enrolled with the course.\n"
